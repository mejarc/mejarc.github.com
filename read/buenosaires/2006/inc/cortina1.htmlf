<p>Just woke up from a nap.  I dreamed about reading a travel guidebook.  Even in my dream these kinds of books are full of nonessential data&ndash;the fourth largest such-and-such, founded in blah-blah-blah by So-and-so.  The guidebook in my dream is about traveling in Minnesota.  I learn from its text that Minnesota's chief exports are blueberries and mineral water.</p>

I wake up.  It's time to dress for dinner.</p>
