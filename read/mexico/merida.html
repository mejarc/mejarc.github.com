				 <p><small>"San Francisco? Ah, <i>cerca</i> Redwood City!" --Young man in souvenir shop.</small></p> 
				 <p><small>***<br />At eight o'clock Se&ntilde;or Antonio Bustillos was ready to drive us to the Puuc hills ("the Mayan Alps," he remarked). Among the pleasures of a guided tour conducted by Sr. Bustillos:</small></p> 
				<ul>
					 <li><p><small>his finger pointing out the delicate painting remaining on the ceiling of the Governor's Palace at Uxmal, clearly his favorite of the ruins.</small></p></li> 
					 <li><p><small>a stop at Santa Elena to cram into the adobe house and smoky cooking shed of a Maya family. Michael and I both confused as to protocol: what if Maya villagers came without announcement to tour our house? Sure, we didn't poke into closets, not that there were any. Our larger bodies seemed invasion enough.</small></p></li> 
					 <li><p><small>quiet talk with ruin site caretakers, all Maya. These people live at the less-visited ruins, have hammocks, flocks of turkeys, thatched-roof houses-- pretty much the same earthly goods as those of the sites' builders almost a thousand years ago.</small></p></li> 
				</ul>
				 <p><small>***<br />Uxmal: Sr. Bustillos did not include the Temple of the Phalluses on our tour. At 9:30 a.m. the horsefly-sized mosquitoes already oppressive. Pyramid of the Magician beckoning for a climb yet closed for restoration.</small></p> 
				 <p><small>Kabah: bats, flapping around Michael's head. A platform with one row of glyphs, all that remains of a two-room building, a book in architectural form. Sr. Bustillos takes a ballpoint pen and draws the Maya glyph for infinity on his hand, explaining to us how sophisticated this culture's mathematics were.</small></p> 
				 <p><small>Labn&aacute;: the arch, the disorganized piles of stones nearby, the <i>sacbe</i>, the Mirador. Sr. Bustillos sighing that twenty years ago the site was in better shape: there was even statuary on the now-desolate Mirador. The arch exerting power over my eyes-- I look at it again and again.</small></p> 
				 <p><small>Sayil: several piles of stones shaded by jungle trees, and one building reconstructed. Image of the Descending God, born naked and headfirst. I am looking for traces of paint when I hear sounds familiar to me only from Martin Denny albums-- two or three tropical birds challenging each other. Sighting of a mot-mot, turquoise and yellow, on a limb above the caretaker's turkeys, these lean birds high-stepping around the mimosas.</small></p>
