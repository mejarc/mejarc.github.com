...Bink and I watched the most staggering piece of footage I've ever seen.  Its incredibility paradoxically brought to me a more solid understanding of the day's significance.

The video was the work of a camera crew which had somehow scrambled into place after the first World Trade Center impact.  Intended to capture images of the billowing smoke, the camera filmed instead a jet airliner vanishing into the second World Trade Center tower.  As I watched I wanted to think that I was seeing <i>The Matrix</i> again, and that this plane would emerge whole on the other side of the building, having rearranged the molecules of the skyscraper's glass windows to some readily repaired plasma.

I watched the news show's rerun of the video perhaps three or four times in fifteen minutes, and each time I had managed to forget the ending.
