        <p>A few of the sites and applications I've worked on:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Work It Out</dt>
          <dd>A responsive web application, designed and developed from back to front by myself. TypeScript/React for
            the user interface,
            working with Express and
            MongoDB for the server side, with Jest unit testing. Give it a try: <a href="//work-it-out.today">Work It
              Out</a></dd>
          <dt> Cambria Center for the Arts</dt>
          <dd>
            Responsive front-end components (JavaScript/CSS/HTML) for a vibrant, busy arts
            center's Web site, serving up announcements, ticket sales, gallery
            images, and event calendars.
          </dd>
          <dt>Auto-not</dt>
          <dd>
            Irritated into action by HTML5's <code>autoplay</code> attribute on
            <code> video</code> elements, I built a Chrome browser extension to
            zap these videos from a web page.
          </dd>

          <dt>GE Global Research</dt>
          <dd>
            Wrangled an ornery herd of Grunt scripts, Bower packages, and Twitter
            Bootstrap forks into the Industrial Internet Design System (IIDS)
            , a framework of browser-side components for Java and .NET developers
            to use in their applications.
          </dd>
          <dt>Fresh Step</dt>
          <dd>
            Was handed a few debugging issues on a catchy, consumer-oriented site
            with lots of HTML5/CSS3/jQuery doodads. My bigger task: maintaining
            focus while proofreading Web copy about desirable properties in cat
            litter.
          </dd>
          <dt> Smartleaf</dt>
          <dd>
            I created interface elements for a remarkably abstruse application for
            some obscure form of investing you and I will probably never make.
            Really gained appreciation for what genius user interface designers
            like Gino Lee can do with such difficult requirements.
          </dd>
          <dt>TripIt</dt>
          <dd>
            Joined two other developers and the two company founders at one big
            table; found this to be a really productive and satisfying setup. Lots
            of quick changes to Symfony (PHP) templates in CSS and YUI JavaScript
            modules.
          </dd>
          <dt>Vox Blog Themes</dt>
          <dd>
            Sigh. This was a great project: to separate markup and design so
            completely that a user could change her blog theme with the click of
            one button. Not to be confused with the news site that has inherited the same URL. <br>We were
            clobbered by Facebook.
          </dd>
          <dt>Errands On The Way</dt>
          <dd>
            I worked with Jason, Christine, and Ryan in a very satisfying week of
            test-driven development, on a mobile-first Rails/Postgres application helping
            the user find places to fulfill her errands along a given route.
          </dd>
          <dt>The Addis Group</dt>
          <dd>
            I designed and built a content management system (CMS) in
            PHP/MySQL to enable this award-winning branding agency to update its
            redeveloped Web site with high-quality images and content.
